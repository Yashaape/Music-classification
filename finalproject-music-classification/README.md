You and your group partners will work on a semester-long course project in this class. **The final project aims to apply deep learning knowledge by designing and developing a deep learning-based application. You have the following checklists for the final project.**

1. **Project Proposal Report**
The proposal should be one paragraph (200-300 words). Your project proposal should describe:
   - What is the problem that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting?
   - What reading will you examine to provide context and background?
   - What data will you use? If you are collecting new data, how will you do it?
   - What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you use them, and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations? You don't have to have an exact answer at this point, but you should have a general sense of how you will approach the problem you are working on.
   -  How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g., plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g., what performance metrics or statistical tests)?
2. **Project proposal In-class presentation** 
   - All group members MUST be present during the mid-progress presentation to the class (unless there is an emergency, such as a health or family emergency). 
   - Prepare slides based on your written report. It will be an 8-minute presentation (max).  Each member will present for around 2 minutes. If you miss the presentation without any valid reason(s), you will not get points in this task.
   - The instructor and your cohorts will give feedback on the project (for 2 minutes). 
   - In summary, each group will have 10 minutes (max) for presentation and feedback. 
3. **Mid-Progress Report** 
   - Extend your proposal to 3 to 4 pages. You can finish the related work section at this milestone. You can also complete some parts mentioned in final written report section partially.
   - Group work plan ( who will do which part)
4. **Mid Progress Presentation**
   - All group members MUST be present during the mid-progress presentation to the class (unless there is an emergency such as a health or family emergency). 
   - Prepare slides for an 8-minute presentation (max).  Each member will present for around 2 minutes.  If you miss the presentation without any valid reason(s), you will not get points in this task.
   - In this presentation, you will show the current status of the project.  
     - You can present a detailed model or application of your project. 
     - You can show the code you have done so far. 
   - The instructor and your cohorts will give feedback on the project (for 2 minutes). 
   - In summary, each group will have 12 minutes (max) for presentation and feedback. 
5. **Final Presentation (Final week in class)**
   - Prepare slides for a 9 minutes presentation and project/app demo for a 3-minute presentation.  Each member will present for 2 minutes or more.  If you miss the presentation without any valid reason(s), you will not get points in this task.
   - The presentation contents will be similar to your written report and submitted code. 
   - Don’t forget to mention the challenging part in the presentation and demo your project for 3 minutes out of 12 minutes. 
   - Don’t forget to mention the innovation and merit of your project.

6. **Final written report**
Your final write-up is required to be between 6 - 8 pages (exluding appendix). I will provide a template to write a report. The following is a suggested structure for your report, as well as the rubric that we will follow when evaluating the final report. 

   - Title, Author(s)
   - Abstract: Briefly describe your problem, approach, and key results. Should be no more than 300 words.
   - Introduction (10%): Describe the problem you are working on, why it's important, and an overview of your results
   - Related Work (10%): Discuss published work that relates to your project. How is your approach similar or different from others?
   - Data (10%): Describe the data you are working with for your project. What type of data is it? Where did it come from? How much data are you working with? Did you have to do any preprocessing, filtering, or other special treatment to use this data in your project?
   - Methods (30%): Discuss your approach for solving the problems that you set up in the introduction. Why is your approach the right thing to do? Did you consider alternative approaches? You should demonstrate that you have applied ideas and skills built up during the quarter to tackling your problem of choice. It may be helpful to include figures, diagrams, or tables to describe your method or compare it with other methods.
   - Experiments (30%): Discuss the experiments that you performed to demonstrate that your approach solves the problem. The exact experiments will vary depending on the project, but you might compare with previously published methods, perform an ablation study to determine the impact of various components of your system, experiment with different hyperparameters or architectural choices, use visualization techniques to gain insight into how your model works, discuss common failure modes of your model, etc. You should include graphs, tables, or other figures to illustrate your experimental results.
   - Conclusion (5%) Summarize your key results - what have you learned? Suggest ideas for future extensions or new applications of your ideas.
   - Conclusion (5%) Summarize your key results - what have you learned? Suggest ideas for future extensions or new applications of your ideas.

7. **Final deliverable** You have to push your final code, video, report, all presentation slides into your group Github repo. 

Your submission will be graded by simply running it and evaluating its functionality. It does not need to be perfect or bug-free to receive **partial** credit.
